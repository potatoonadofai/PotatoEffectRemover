#PotatoEffectRemover mod
This is my first mod. It is used to remove a specified type of event from a level.
When this mod is enabled, the level saving function is disabled, preventing you from accidentally overwriting the deleted level over the original level.

I've only tested it on windows, and it performed well in versions 2.5.0, 2.9.1, and 2.9.3.
